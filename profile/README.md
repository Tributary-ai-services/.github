# üåä Tributary AI Services

**The open-source stream of intelligence powering next-gen RAG systems.**

Tributary AI Services is an open-source, modular ecosystem for building advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Designed for AI developers, ML engineers, and infrastructure teams, it brings together the essential components needed to create scalable, intelligent, and explainable AI pipelines.

## üîç What Is Tributary?

Tributary is a foundation for constructing powerful, production-ready RAG systems. Its components are built for flexibility, composability, and extensibility ‚Äî supporting a wide range of workflows across ingestion, retrieval, orchestration, and generation.

## üöÄ Features & Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Currently Available

- **DeepLake Integration**
  API bindings and SDK wrappers to interface with [DeepLake](https://activeloop.ai/) vector databases for fast, scalable retrieval.
  This provides an alternative to tightly linking Python libraries, reducing application size and opening DeepLake to developers using other programming languages

- **AudiModal Data Compliance Multimodal Ingest**
  Scalable, fault-tolerant ingestion pipelines with observability and multi-source support.
  If supports secure ingest and identified PII, HIPAA, GDPR, and many other compliance standards

### üõ†Ô∏è Coming Soon

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
  An advanced open implementation, featuring a server registry and discovery mechanism for orchestrating model context services.

- **Knowledge Graph Integration**
  Semantic linking and graph-based enrichment to enhance retrieval precision and context depth.

- **Workflow & Agent Generation**
  Tools to compose multi-step workflows and spawn intelligent agents dynamically.

- **Analytics & Visualization**
  Real-time observability, performance metrics, and system-level dashboards for RAG-based applications.

## üß© Architecture Philosophy

Tributary is designed as a loosely coupled set of interoperable services. It follows cloud-native principles, supports modern orchestration platforms, and prioritizes:

![Event Orchestration](event-automation.png)

- **Transparency** over black-box automation
- **Extensibility** through open protocols and registries
- **Scalability** via containerized, composable deployments
- **Community collaboration** as a first-class goal
